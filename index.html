                You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that
                work.
                That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web
                Development
                Hero. <br>

                        function,
                        efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework
                        called
                        Vue
                        JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.

                        They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website
                        and
                        showed
                        it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
